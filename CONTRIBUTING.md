# Contributing to mce-operator-bundle

Thank you for your interest in contributing to mce-operator-bundle!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Operator SDK 1.28+
- Podman or Docker
- Access to a Quay.io account for testing
- Basic understanding of OLM bundle format

## Development Workflow

### Building

```bash
make bundle        # Generate bundle manifests
make bundle-build  # Build bundle image
```

### Testing

```bash
# Validate bundle format
operator-sdk bundle validate ./bundle

# Full validation suite
operator-sdk bundle validate ./bundle --select-optional suite=operatorframework
```

### Code Style

- Bundle manifests follow OLM schema
- Use `make bundle` to regenerate from upstream operator
- Validate changes with `operator-sdk bundle validate`

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`
2. Make your changes
3. Run validation: `operator-sdk bundle validate ./bundle`
4. Submit a pull request with a clear description
