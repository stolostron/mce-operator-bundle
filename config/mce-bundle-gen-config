# This Bash fragment is sourced by various scripts.
#
# Its job is to set a bunch of configuration variables as expected by the
# bundle manifest generation scripts that source it. Because it is Bash, you
# can use any Bash constructs you want here, but be careful about setting
# variables that might break the sourcing script.

#--------------------------------------------------------------------
# Config properties that are unique for each product (ACM vs. MCE)
# and often/occasionally differ release-to-release.
#
# Be sure to consider these settings in release-to-release cutovers.
#--------------------------------------------------------------------

# List or range of OCP versions to which bundles should be published.
# Note: This variable is used/effective only for CPASS builds. For Konflux
# builds, this range is now set in configuration files for the catalog
# generation steps.

# Note: MCE 2.11 is compatible with OCP 4.21.
# Official support covers [N+1, N-2], with [N-3/4] allowed as an exception.
ocp_versions="v4.19-v4.23"

# Specify the lists of architectures and operating systems we support.

# Since MCE 2.0:
cfg_supported_op_syss=("linux")
cfg_supported_archs=("amd64" "ppc64le" "s390x" "arm64")

# Specify EUS-release configuration:

cfg_first_eus_release_xy=2.6
cfg_eus_release_cadence=2

# Special configuration for version resync scenarios:
# Use this to override the automatic skipRange calculation when doing version jumps.
# Example: If MCE jumps from 2.18 to 5.0, set: cfg_min_upgrade_version="2.18.0"
#
# NOTE: For normal sequential releases, leave this commented out to use automatic
# skipRange calculation. Only uncomment and set this for version jumps.
# cfg_min_upgrade_version="X.Y.0"

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
# Config properties that are unique for each product (ACM vs. MCE)
# but usually constant across releases of the product.

# Name of the OLM operator package:
